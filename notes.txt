install the dependencies by running from the root directoy of the project:
'npm install'
build the project by running from the root directory of the project
'npm build' or if you want the page to be refreshed when you make changes to the code 'npm build:watch'
if you are running in debug mode, in assets/views/homepage.ejs, change the reference to 'reactbunle.min.js' to 'reactbundle.js'

if you wish to work on the backend, instead of using the remote genenetwork backend, go into domain.js and change the domain to
''
this may change some behaviour, for example the max size of a GET request is probably larger on the remote server than on your localhost

start up the redis server:
'redis-server' or 'brew services start redis' or any other way you may have installed it
start up the elastic search server:
'/usr/local/Cellar/elasticsearch\@2.4/2.4.6/bin/elasticsearch' or 'brew services start elasticsearch@2.4' or any other way you may have installed it
start up the prediction server:
cd to servers/PredictionServer/
'node PredictionServer.js' from the root directory of the project
load the pwa server in memory:
cd to servers/PWAServer/
'node --max-old-space-size=8192 PWAServerInMem.js' from the root directory of the project

start the application by running from the root directory:
'npm start'
you should now be able to see the page at localhost:80 in your browser

if you get grunt errors when doing 'npm start' and see 404s on some of the resources on the homepage, your grunt version may be too new. run:
'npm i natives'
then redo the build and run


To make updates for the server, build a new docker image with

    docker build -t <hub_directory>/<tagname>:<tagversion>

e.g.

    docker build -t ndeklein/metabrainnetwork:v1.1.server

Then push to docker hub with

    docker push ndeklein/metabrainnetwork:v1.1.server

The <hub_directory>/<tagname>:<tagversion> has to match the one that is used in the docker-compose file in docker_compose/servers/docker-compose.yml
